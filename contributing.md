## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Contribution Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue
*   **Creating an Issue**: You MUST use the following format or it will be closed.
    *   **Required Tag**: `apertre3.0`
    *   **One Difficulty Tag**: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` (Zero other difficulty tags).
    *   **Format**:
        *   Clear description
        *   Screenshots (if UI/Frontend)
        *   Steps to reproduce (if Bug)

### 2. Wait for Assignment
*   A Project Admin or Mentor must assign the issue to you.
*   **Do not create a PR before assignment.**

### 3. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dipanita45/HEALCONNECT.git
cd HEALCONNECT
```

### 4. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

### 5. Make Changes & Commit
*   Write clean, readable code.
*   Remove all `console.log` and unused files.

### 6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
*   **Title**: Clear and descriptive (e.g., "Fix: Navigation overlap on mobile").
*   **Description**:
    *   Mention the issue: `Closes #IssueNumber`
    *   Explain your changes.
    *   **Screenshots**: MANDATORY for UI changes.
*   **Tags**:
    *   request the **`apertre3.0`** tag.
    *   request the **Difficulty Tag** (`easy`/`medium`/`hard`) that matches your issue.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
*   **PRs without `apertre3.0` and a difficulty tag will NOT receive points.**
*   Mentees must request mentors to add these tags if they are missing.
*   Violating rules or offensive behavior results in disqualification.

Happy Coding! 🚀
